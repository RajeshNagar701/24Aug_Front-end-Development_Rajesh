JavaScript Variable Scope

The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.



Type of variable
1:) Var
The variables that are defined with var statement have function scope.
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.
var is an ECMAScript1 feature.

2:) Let
The variables that are defined with let statement have block scope.
We cannot declare a variable more than once if we defined that previously in the same scope.
let is a feature of ES6.

3:) Const

value is constant and unchangeble
